Packet sniffer

For our End semester Project we are building a packet sniffer program that :

•	captures all the incoming and outgoing traffic on our local host network 

•	differentiates between ipv4 and ipv6 protocols

•	checks to see what type of Segment it contains ( TCP, UDP or ICMP)

•	opens corresponding segments and displays the information contained within depending on type of segment.
